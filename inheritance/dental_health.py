# In this exercise, we'll be modelling a routine for proper dental health,
# which includes brushing our teeth, flossing, and using mouthwash.
# The order of these three varies from person to person.

# Declare a DentalHealthItem class. Its initialization should set a "price"
# attribute.

# Declare a Toothbrush subclass that inherits from DentalHealthItem.
# On it, define a "use" instance method that returns "Brushing the teeth"

# Declare a Floss subclass that inherits from DentalHealthItem.
# On it, define a "use" instance method that returns "Flossing the teeth"

# Declare a Mouthwash subclass that inherits from DentalHealthItem.
# On it, define a "use" instance method that returns "Washing the teeth"

# Instantiate an instance of a Toothbrush and assign it a "toothbrush" variable.
# Instantiate an instance of a Floss and assign it a "floss" variable.
# Instantiate an instance of a Mouthwash and assign it a "mouthwash" variable.

# Declare a "dental_health_kit" variable. It should be a list that stores the three objects.
 
# Import the "random" module (see last lesson for reference). 
# Invoke the "shuffle" function from the module, passing in the dental_health_kit list. 
# This will mutate the list, randomizing the order of its elements.

# Use list comprehension to invoke the "use" method on all three objects in "dental_health_kit".
# Assign the resulting list of strings to an "actions" variable.
